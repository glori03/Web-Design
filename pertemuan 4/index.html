               The<span><b> COVID-19</b></span>  vaccines that are currently in development or have been approved are expected 
               to provide at least some protection against new virus variants because these vaccines elicit a broad immune 
               response involving a range of antibodies and cells.Therefore, changes or mutations in the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective. 
               In the event that any of these vaccines prove to be less effective against one or more variants,
               it will be possible to change the composition of the vaccines to protect against these variants.

                Vaccines are a critical tool in the battle against <b>COVID-19</b>,
                and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to using the tools we already have.
                <i>We must not put off getting vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants,</i>
                and we must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be somewhat less effective against some of the <b>COVID-19</b> virus variants. 
                We need to use the tools we have in hand even while we continue to improve those tools.
                <u>We are all safe only if everyone is safe.</u>
